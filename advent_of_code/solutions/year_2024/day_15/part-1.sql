/*
    The issue with recursive CTEs is that every intermediate result is
    _always_ appended to the CTE

    This is often helpful, but in a case like this, it just balloons the
    memory usage because I'd only care about the _latest_ intermediate
    result

    There's probably a smart way around this, but alas, I'm not smart
    enough
